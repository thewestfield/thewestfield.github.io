      <h3><b>England’s Great escape from peril </b></h3>
      <h5>On 5th September Jonny Bairstow and ex-captain Joe Root succeeded in making runs repeatedly, beating cover and point every time, creating the offside “a run making machine”. India grabbed the win on the first 2 days, and Ben Stokes, new captain of England, managed to hold on to his dignity as England managed to bring the 5-day series test match to a draw,<span> <b> Vivaan Dagar 9B</b></span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>The outstanding performances of Root and Bairstow have stunned not only the audience but also the Indian bowlers, who include many of the top bowlers in the world. Root scoring a mass number of 143 not out and Bairstow with 114 not out making one of the best partnerships England could have ever had to seal this game. 

 

<p>England casually completed a record 378 chase to quickly defeat India on the final morning of its fifth test at Edgbaston. 

<p>England's ninth-largest chase in the history of Test cricket, and their highest successful one, was led by Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow. 

<p>Root and Bairstow cruised with surprising ease as England won by seven wickets, one of their all-time best triumphs, after needing further 119 from their overnight 259-3. 

<p>Bairstow reached his second century of the game at 114 not out, while Root finished undefeated at 142 in an unbroken partnership of 269 runs. 

<p>Under the leadership of new captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum, they lifted England to a new level in what is shaping up to be a magnificent summer. 

<p>Five weeks ago, England's Test cricket was in disarray. McCullum and Stokes were tasked with bringing the squad back to life after they had lost 16 of their previous 17 games. 

<p>Even though the 3-0 series victory against New Zealand was fantastic, playing "Bazball" against the strong Indians felt different. 

<p>Throughout this game, the home team was under significant pressure at various points. In response to India's first-innings 416, they were 83-5; nevertheless, on Monday, India was 322 up with five second-innings wickets yet to fall. 

<p>However, England's confidence that they could pursue any goal was validated, primarily as a result of the rash progress they made on a brilliant fourth afternoon. 

Strangely, the fifth morning was nearly depressing considering the significance of the outcome. 

All of the free tickets were claimed, but Edgbaston was far from full while Root and Bairstow eliminated what little danger there had been in the pursuit. 

That in no way lessens what England has achieved; to pass 378 for the cost of just three wickets is simply amazing. 

  

<p>What future goals can this new England pursue? 

 

<p>England March On and Disdain Failure:

 

<p>New white-ball captain Jos Buttler says England will continue to be "really aggressive and not afraid of failure" when he is in charge. 

<p>Former vice-captain of England Jos Buttler replaced Eoin Morgan two weeks ago, after Morgan ended his captaincy on a high, winning the 2019 50 overs World Cup, England’s first title in World Cup history. 

<p>He will validate his captaincy in the first few matches as captain if he leads England to victory against India in the T20 format. 

<p>Working alongside the new head coach, Australian Matthew Mott, the pair will be looking to crush India down to their toes, building up the pressure for the upcoming ODI matches and ultimately for the T20 World Cup in which they hope to defend their title as reigning ODI world Champions. 

<p>In the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup, which Australia won, England was defeated by New Zealand. 

"I want us to play in exactly the same fashion - to be really positive, really aggressive and not afraid of failure” says the wicket-keeper Jos Buttler. 

<p>This positive attitude has been quite evident over the years. After England’s atrocious performance in the 2015 World Cup, the more ‘aggressive’ approach led them to win the 2019 cricket World Cup in which many records were broken, for example Eoin Morgan’s 16 sixes in one game against Afghanistan. This approach has also led England to hold the world record number of runs in one game, reaching an immense total of 496-6 against the Netherlands.  

<p>This approach has also been taken on by Test Captain Ben Stokes in which England successfully pursued India’s total of 378 runs. Buttler said he is expecting a "really tough challenge" from India as there is "so much strength in depth and talent" in their squad but he believes if they march strong and are not afraid to lose, victory will be in their path.  </p>

      <h3><b>Winter World Cup Preview</b></h3>
      <h5>The whole world is waiting in nail-biting anticipation for the most prestigious event in world football, the pride of nations; hoping for the ultimate glory of being crowned champions, an honour that has only belonged to eight different nations in over 90 years,<span> <b> Joshua Saiki 9B</b></span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Despite all its rich history, Qatar 2022 will be the first time for many things concerning the World Cup. It is the smallest nation by area ever to host a FIFA World Cup. It is also the first Arab and first Muslim country to do so. Qatar will also be home to the only tournament so far not to be held in May, June, or July, due to its sweltering heat. 

<p>In qualifying, Italy, four-time world champions, suffered a devastating defeat to North Macedonia on March 24, putting an end to their hopes of competing in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, months after emerging victorious in the postponed UEFA Euro 2020. Reminding us of the unpredictability of the beautiful game and stirring up anticipation for the whirlwind of events set to take place this winter. There are so many questions to answer: 

<p>Can England end their 56-year-old drought? 

Or will France retain their grip on the crown? 

Or will it all come crashing down as an underdog storms to glory? 

<p>As with every tournament, there are favourites to go all the way. Eyes will be on reigning champions Les Bleus, as they will return to world football with a star-studded team, and though the official squad has not yet been named, there is no doubt it will include many players from their last victorious campaign including PSG’s Kylian Mbappé, Chelsea’s N’Golo Kanté and the ever-present Hugo Lloris from Spurs between the sticks. 

<p>Even more exciting is Karim Benzema’s return from exile, which will certainly be a boost to their strength and squad depth. Seen as a Ballon d‘Or contender by many, he has been in blistering form this season with Real Madrid, which many consider as his breakout season at the age of 34, winning LaLiga and the Champions League in which he scored back-to-back hattricks and finishing as the top scorer in both prestigious competitions. Although he was recalled to the national team before Euro “2020”, he missed the World Cup triumph of 2018, perhaps a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that escaped him. But he will be eager to ensure that is not the case. If he succeeds, France will become only the third nation to retain the World Cup and the first do so in 60 years. 

<p>Moreover, a supercomputer seems to have great faith in France’s ability. This piece of technology from The Analyst specializes in predicting outcomes of tournaments and from the simulation of the tournament run over 1000 times, France was ranked as the most likely winner, with a 17.93% probability, followed by Brazil then Spain. 

<p>Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal and Messi’s Argentina were also included in this controversial list and the rift between the fans of these stars is comparable to a political divide! For several years, there has been fierce debate between the supporters of each as to who should be crowned the Greatest of All Time, and one of them winning a World Cup would surely settle it. To top it off, this will almost certainly be the last World Cup for both. Yet surprisingly, both Portugal and Argentina were outside the top five. In fact, their combined likelihood - either Messi or Ronaldo capping their career with a World Cup victory is ­– combined – 11.6%. 

<p>A phenomenon that always raptures attention and provokes speculation from fans and pundits is the Group of Death, a particular group which contains more than 2 strong competitors, more than the number of spaces available for the round of 16. Unusually, at this year’s world cup there is no obvious ‘group of death’, but that is certainly no reason to lose interest. In fact, this presents a perfect scenario for underdogs and upsets, the joy of football. 

<p>Speaking of underdogs, there are some teams to look out for which have recently gained momentum in international football. One of these would be Sadio Mane’s Senegal who just edged out Mohammed Salah’s Egypt from a spot at this year’s World Cup; the now former Liverpool teammates continuing their derby from the African Cup of Nations Final, which also went Senegal’s way. In their hot run of form, could we see the first African team to lift the World Cup? 

<p>The odds are stacked against them, but they have a history of causing upsets. Peculiarly, in 2002, the last time France were reigning champions, which was Senegal’s first appearance in the World Cup, they stunned Les Bleus, winning 1-0 in the opening game. France was ranked 40 places above them and had only lost 6 times since crowned as World Champions. France continued in a dismal manner, failing to score any goals or win a single game, being eliminated in the group stages. Their confidence had been destroyed by Senegal. Whereas Senegal would go on all the way to the quarter finals, their best World Cup performance. 

<p>With stars at both ends including Édouard Mendy and Sadio Mané, who knows how far they go this time? 

<p>Apart from the dark horses, one thing that makes the WC amazing is the concentration of world-class talent in this tournament, from breakout stars to seasoned veterans proving their class once more, we are always in for a treat. Their incredible displays of skill consistently remind us why we love watching the best in the world at what they do, and surely this year will be no different. 

<p>As mentioned before, French striker Karim Benzema was a key player in their UCL victory of 21/22, yet the team against which he sealed a historic comeback in the semi-final is also brimming with high-quality footballers. Kevin De Bruyne is a player who has been instrumental in Manchester City’s recent success and even if Beligum were not currently 1st in FIFA’s rankings, the midfield maestro would be one to watch. He has experience on the biggest stage, helping his nation to an emphatic 3rd place finish in 2018 and will no doubt be hungry for more this time. 

<p>Kylian Mbappe is a special talent – by the age of 18, he had already scored in and won a World Cup Final. Despite his age, it is hard to place him with other youngsters – it is unbelievable what he’s achieved at such a young age. What will he do for an encore in Qatar? 

<p>Another young but already feared star hails from 2010 winners Spain. Pedri will only turn 20 mid-way through the tournament, and he already starred at last summer’s Euros showing his incredible potential. Barcelona’s new No.8 has it all for a central midfielder: a combination of excellent passing, movement, and an extraordinary work-rate. He will be a joy to watch. 

<p>Four games. No wins. A 4-0 loss at home. With only five months till the opening of the 2022 Qatar World Cup on November 21, things don't seem bright for England. Their struggle in UEFA Nations League this year is a worrying sign ahead of the world cup. 

<p>At several times in recent years much scathing criticism has been aimed at manager Gareth Southgate. However, it must be acknowledged that under his leadership, England have gone from hopefuls to genuine contenders in the last two major competitions, placing 4th and 2nd  respectively. As usual, there is an undertone of optimism in the nation. Yet the unfortunate fact that it falls during the regular season would likely mean that several players will be instructed to take it easy by their clubs. 

<p>Can manager Gareth Southgate turn it around by November? We have 129 days to find out.

      <h3><b>What’s the point of being active?  </b></h3>
      <h5>With recent and upcoming sporting events such as Wimbledon and the FIFA World Cup, people all over the world are engrossed in following and watching sports,<span> <b> William Howard 9B</b></span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Sports stars are idolised; often their incredible fitness and physique makes them the adoration of their fans. Many sports fans aspire to achieve the greatness of these athletes, yet most have no idea where to start in achieving their goals. These goals may range from simply being fit and healthy to competing in sport at an elite level. 

<p>According to Cancer Research UK more than 6 in 10 people are obese or overweight in England (2018-19). Being overweight has a cohort of effects including (but not limited to) leading to 13 different types of cancer, high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease. Preventing oneself from becoming unfit or unhealthily obese should be a priority and this article will explain some ways to lead a happy and healthy life. 

<p>The best way to be fit is to do any form of physical activity, from just walking to playing a contact sport. Anything that puts the muscles to work and raises the heart rate is beneficial in a range of ways, not just for cardiovascular fitness. For example, a Harvard university study found that walking for just an hour a day counteracted the effect of weight-promoting genes by fifty percent as well as boosting immunity and burning calories. In addition, there are mental benefits to spending time outdoors such as reducing stress and aiding relaxation. 

<p>The most important thing for effective physical activity is consistency. It is important to find an activity you enjoy otherwise it will be difficult to make it a regular habit. 

<p>One popular and accessible choice of exercise is going to a gym. There are many different activities there and they should be chosen based on your goals. For instance, if your goal was specifically fat loss, then cardio machines (treadmill, Rowing machine, stair climber) should be used because they are especially useful for burning calories, as well as increasing cardiovascular health and blood sugar regulation. If building muscle was the goal, then the free weights and machines would be used. 

<p>In addition, diet is a key factor in increasing physical health. Eating a balanced diet is necessary to be healthy and according to the NHS, most people in the UK eat and drink too many saturated fats, sugar and salt, and not enough fruit, vegetables, oily fish, or fibre, leading to too many calories and weight gain as well as health issues. Popular foods that include unhealthy amounts of these substances include bacon and other processed meats, dairy, butter, lard, and mayonnaise. We should aim to eat at least 5 fruits and vegetables per day which [provide us with much-needed fibres, and vitamins. Protein is also useful, especially for people exercising at a high intensity; when digested, it is broken down into amino acids which is then used to help repair the microtears in muscles, building them back stronger. 

<p>Sleep is also vital to leading a fit and healthy lifestyle. By sleeping an adequate amount, (the consensus being that teenagers should sleep for 8-10 hours each night) the body gets a chance to recover energy and repair itself, builds up the muscles worked during exercise. 

<p>“We exercise for a purpose: for cardiovascular health, to increase lean muscle mass, to improve endurance, and more. All of these 'goals' require sleep,” says W. Christopher Winter, MD, the president of Charlottesville Neurology and Sleep Medicine. 

<p>Finally, the importance of drinking enough water cannot be overstated. It allows us to get rid of excess heat as sweat and helps to digest food and transport nutrients around the body. It also helps to fuel the muscles, so drinking before, during and after exercise will boost energy and reduce those dreaded cramps. 

<p>In conclusion, there are a multitude of ways to increase fitness and therefore lead a happier and healthier life. If all of them are done well, then you will transform your athletic performance and your overall quality of life, whilst also reducing risk of disease. So there is every reason not to get active today.

      <h3><b>THE TALE OF TECHNOBLADE  </b></h3>
      <h5>Technoblade. The name rings familiar to many people around the globe, more now than ever and for good reason. A renowned youtuber and the man credited as ‘The Best Minecraft Player alive.’,<span> <b> Shayan Sabeshan 9B</b></span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p> For many months until now, it seemed that Technoblade’s channel was becoming increasingly inactive by the day and his channel, barren of any new content or videos to the public, following his diagnosis of Sarcoma, a rare type of cancer. Then came the 1st of July, where a long awaited video was uploaded on the platform, entitled ‘So Long Nerds.’ Yet, as many soon came to realise, Technoblade was nowhere to be seen and all that could be seen was a man and what appeared to be Technoblade’s dog sitting quietly in a room. The man introduced himself as the father of Technoblade and read out a prepared letter on behalf of his son ‘Hello everyone. Technoblade here. If you’re watching this, I’m dead.’ A statement that all those who had known Technoblade had dreaded to hear. A statement that the brought the community together. A statement that ended the Tale of Technoblade. 

<p>Technoblade, or otherwise known, from the recent revelation in his post-mortem video, as his birth name Alex, began as a young, dedicated creator and despite knowing what little impact his poorly edited videos had on the platform, his attitude towards what seemed to be certain failure never seemed to waver and every view he earned, he coveted and cherished. 

<p>What set Technoblade apart from the roster of YouTube’s creators? Even following the decline of Minecraft’s popularity, Technoblade persevered through the trying times still regularly releasing capital and high quality content, whilst his channel undertook a newfound popularity and status within the community. His unique and distinct comedic talent, composed of his unparalleled story-telling, ‘good-natured humility’ and ‘self-deprecating wit’, was one that was set apart from the majority of creators on the platform. Secondly, his respect and unwavering loyalty towards his followers, gradually building up and creating one of the most beloved and eccentric communities on YouTube, with those who mutually respected and cared for each other and shared a communal enjoyment over Technoblade’s content. Finally, his more outlandish, bizarre and quirky content that gifted him a spot as one of the most driven and yet, whimsical creators out there.  

<p>What was his legacy? Even through his tiring treatment, a choice was made by Technoblade – he would persist and send his viewers off on a high note and do the absolute best he could for the community with what minimal time he had left. Even in his final hours, he willingly decided to write the script that his father was to read, a mere 8 hours before his death. All to ensure that his devoted followers would be given as much closure as they could receive and that they would be fine, even after his death. His death sparked the re-emergence of many mostly inactive members of the community, brought together his friends and family, and the news spread like wildfire across the globe, featuring on many of the world’s foremost news channels. Not only the Minecraft community, but communities all across the Internet came together through social media to grieve the death of Technoblade. Communities, full of artists and animators so dedicated to their craft as Techno was, producing all sorts of prodigious and marvellous artwork and a myriad of inspired and talented players built towering monuments to Techno and thousands of celebrities shared their heartfelt tributes and gave their condolences to Technoblade. To Alex. All of whom, sharing that he would never be forgotten and that ‘Technoblade Never Dies!’  </p>

<h5>GRAVITY FALLS:</h5> 

<p>Though the towering animation empire of Disney may be more recognised for its highly influential films of the Silver Age or its extraordinary feats made during its Renaissance era, many have collectively agreed on the eminence and genius behind Gravity Falls. A show that stuck true to its promise of ‘quality over quantity’ with a show-run consisting of only 2 seasons, each with 20 episodes, yet with a near stellar cast of characters with devised and knotty backstories, weird and off-beat personalities and even further entangled relationships. A show that brought forth novel and enthralling concepts that inspired the conception of many of the greatest animated shows in recent history: This is Gravity Falls. 

<p>Gravity Falls follows the Pine twins, Dipper and Mabel, as they navigate their way through the summer with their Great-Uncle Stan in the mysterious town of Gravity Falls and begin to uncover the madness, chaos and mystery surrounding the little and quaint town. 

<p>Dipper and Mabel share such involved ties with one another that it seems almost impossible to encapsulate their relationship in such a cramped article. Their personality traits work extremely well together, which is a given as they were written to do so, however the way that it is portrayed makes it seem that much more natural; Dipper being the one with the academic prowess, the awkward and socially stunted brother and his sister Mabel, more of a brighter and bubbly character, a kind-hearted sister who relishes each and every moment she spends with those she loves. The story they are forced into gives them a true perspective into how deeply they care for each other; acting as an optimistic mirror of the once-strained relationship between two of the other protagonists of the series: their Great Uncles – Stanley and Stanford. At its heart, the show is a wholesome tale of a sincere love between a brother and a sister and what it means to be a family. 

<p>Quite clearly the highlight of the show, the villain – the treacherous and perilous trans-dimensional demon, who carries the name of Bill Cipher. One of the most truly omnipotent and all-knowing beings in fictional history with an almost perfectly suited disposition for both the story and the characters within. Chaotic, conniving and maniacal in nature, a devious and sadistic trickster and a demon with the attributes paralleling that of a God, even capable of annihilating the physical manifestation of time in one fell swoop. Bill’s uncontested in wit, deviousness and potency and his mastery and dominion over all life gave him a presence as one of the more threatening antagonists in recent time, giving us, the audience, every more of a reason to side with our protagonists.  

<p>Bill’s iconic appearance is well-known and for good reason; Bill’s obvious inspiration being the Eye of Providence, the all-seeing eye whereby God surveys all which illustrates Bill as a figure of utmost authority and divinity. Bill’s bright lemon hue though suggesting warmth and happiness, was chosen as a façade, a mask to which Bill was to cower behind, tortured by his grievous acts of the past. For the entirety of his life and even in the event leading to his end, Bill had failed to understand what it meant to feel truly ‘human’. Despite knowing the mysteries and inner workings of our reality, jeering at humanity’s fatal flaws, he failed to recognise his own fatal flaw – his lack of humanity and misunderstanding of what it meant to be human; something that Dipper and Mabel had come to embrace – ‘being human.’

      <h3><b>‘THE FALL OF MEDIA’ </b></h3>
      <h5>If I said that the mainstream is slowly becoming the anti-mainstream, what would that mean to you? For those that are still reading, go to the supplement to read about Minions: Rise of Gru, <span><b>Rudraksh Gangooly 9B</b></span></h5>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>
	  If I said that the mainstream is slowly becoming the anti-mainstream, what would that mean to you? For those that are still reading, go to the supplement to read about Minions: Rise of Gru.  Over the past few years, the oversaturation of media and entertainment has blindsided the implementation of art into popular culture. If I were to tell you that Minions: Rise of Gru deftly marries the bleak, unrelenting tone of its source material with a daring theatrical direction, contrasting with the sprawling epics of thespian hysteria drenched in neon haze of the recent days, with a film of current masterpiece status with little to prove, but enough to satisfy its diehard fans, and welcoming new ones into its cult-like following, would you believe me? Would you take this writer’s words as gospel or satire?  

<p>The truth is, the words of this article will likely be glossed over in the grand scheme of attempts at catering to the generalised animalistic impulses of familiarity through assertions of popular culture.  Whereas the concept of entertainment was once the tinder to a novel landscape of talent, raw human greed has once again found a path to exploit the serotonin, the dopamine and the endorphins for nothing but what a nihilist would see as numbers, numbers in the amount of ineffectual material items, numbers on an ATM machine. Without deterioration into increasingly economical phrasings of our own bleak, self-perpetuating nature of grasping at any chance for our own ambition, whether it be assets or power, and whether it ultimately is at the cost of the sacrifice of others, the world of 'entertainment' or the process of making use of the potential of our conscious' decomposition in response to specifically chemically-engineered content dry will never fade, and will sooner or later never decease, as without our leading figures that one would never see as deceiving or misguiding due to conditioning of loyalty and reliance to the over-arching system from birth, one may have to finally ask themselves whether we live in an artificial world, one where entities of scale far beyond human conception in these numbers that are slowly doubted more and more take every opportunity to capitalise on the vulnerabilities of our own psyche, the psyche capable of tuning out the noise of our ponderous self-inflicted end, and the noise that distracts us from it, which is the noise we will never tune out. 

<p>These traps set out for the public come in many forms. The rise of TikTok has begun to eat away at the attention spans of its young userbase, due to its infinite and addictive nature. As Netflix and other streaming services rapidly grow in expansion across the planet, the pace at which we consume entertainment grows, leaving a growing void of content that must be fully financed and produced at breakneck speeds to satisfy the billions that engage in this culture where the quality of product slowly decreases over time. This brooding consumerism that surrounds media is ever-present and inescapable, your favourite artist will have lines upon lines of merchandise to near-extortionate prices, as the corporate pawns use the average consumer’s lust for what they see as support as the sponsors to their conglomerates. As the standards to satisfying the hyper-active and sensitive minds of children slowly drop over the years from dedicated TV channels (Further reading: Gravity Falls - Shayan Sabeshan) to YouTube videos of industrialised, inane sequences of low-budget animation constructed by an algorithm assessing whatever intellectual properties a child will recognise, often delving into a surreal and inhuman environment, we can only assume the same will happen for the general public as well. Thankfully, a shining beacon in the murky depths of stationary leisure has appeared, in the form of Minions: Rise of Gru, a movie that those of all ages can enjoy. A multi-faceted epic of grand ambition and stunning scope, Minions: Rise of Gru delivers on practically every possible criticism a film like this could face and excels beyond the current standards and boundaries for art in general. And just like how you wouldn’t expect a quick advertisement in the middle of an article criticising the very thing being advertised, the possibilities for monetising every aspect of our lives becomes unpredictable and expands with greater knowledge of human susceptibilities able to be capitalised on.  

<p>With every waking moment, descending into an abyss of a dystopian life becomes more imminent, as more and more of our lives are spent on purely consuming entertainment and a deficit of creative and innovative energy grows. Looking at the 50 highest-grossing films of all time, the current trend of marketability concerns family-friendly blockbusters (with the sole exception of Joker, albeit being from a comic book trademark) produced by a few megalithic corporations again pandering to the people, even if in a less blunt and forwardly extreme method than social media. Social media has been engineered to become the dream of the indolent. With no method of age verification being implemented into these hyper-addictive programs, each generation experiences the lure of constant exposure to the virtual world thriving alongside ours earlier, being rooted deeper into the lives of these very children. 

<p>Gaining insecurity through means of viewing what is presented as the intrinsic basics to one's life via an interface designed to connect, but now is purely used to serve those tenets of cognitive exploitation, is a dangerous game, a game only seen as intrinsic when viewed through the myopic lens of this central indolent that falls in every trap set out for them. But the worst factor being that this indolent is very much aware that he is actively participating in this game but does absolutely nothing to bring himself to face the consequences of what he thinks are rudimentary and eventually meaningless actions, because after all, he is just one of 4.62 billion people connected to the manufactured hivemind for 2 hours and 27 minutes a day. The neurochemical drama of day-to-day life should not be used for capital gain, but nevertheless this system will outlive every person after they die, just multiplying into new forms to adapt to the new levels of extortion that humanity can pull off successfully without any thought of the impact it will have on the future generations. And just like all things have a narrative exactly like a song, a TV show or a movie, they will all have a beginning and an end, but for social media, the end will only occur when the sprawling complexity of the human intellect has entirely diminished, giving this concept a parasitic and destructive lifespan. And now, we are seeing the end of entertainment as we know it now. 

<p>However, the antidote to oversaturation is popularising the antithesis of the ever-popular archetype. In this way, the mainstream is ever-changing and always shifting as radicalism becomes borderline-revolutionary. And as we finally begin to wind down from almost 200-word sentences approaching the style of a purposefully over-sophisticated philosophical manifesto, there may still be uncertainty to whether this was actually a parody of an arrogant and fundamentally egotistically written broadsheet article (hint) or whether anything I mentioned was really taking place. After all, this is all conceptual. But with one last point, viewing the Netflix Top 10 (a system showing the 10 most viewed shows or movies of the day) shows that the consumers tend to favour reality TV more, a more intellectually numb form of entertainment relying on that same method of catering to human impulses with low-stakes drama just like social media. And the same is happening across the board in the world of entertainment. The Spotify Top 50 Songs chart displays dozens upon dozens of commercialised pop songs produced for radio play, written by a dozen record company executives around a table on the top floor of a New York skyscraper trying to wrap their heads around a bar chart of modern trends on a PowerPoint, each having signed a dozen artists completely stripped of artistic value or potential. But the first song, the highest-charting, the most popular song, is different. This is 'Running Up That Hill' by Kate Bush.  

<p>The song has been made popular by the recent season of Stranger Things, released just a few weeks prior to the newspaper's release, but the song itself is from 1985. And it is crushing for this new industry, because amongst all of these attempts to engineer songs that will get the most streams or downloads, the song that beats them all is one from 37 years ago. And it's also quite fitting, as it's the only song on that list to be from the era which is the inverse of everything I have talked about for the past 3 pages, almost as if the only way to gain true, unbridled popularity in the modern age is to look to the past. And this was when the rot of consumerism had not yet settled in to this industry just yet, almost as if it was a wake-up alarm to those dozen executives sitting around that table that their audience was capable of appreciating something other than what has been specifically manufactured for them to enjoy and invest in, because all their audience ever wanted was something that was just unapologetically music for the sake of music, something honest in a dishonest world, something that had the capability to make a resurgence decades after its creation, because finally, after everything that tore media apart, the mainstream went against itself once again, the most popular thing being the opposite of everything popular that came directly before it. And that is quite a beautiful thought, really.
