      <h3><b>Are electric vehicles actually beneficial for the environment?   </b></h3>
      <h5>Manufacturing the battery alone of an electric car releases more CO2 emissions than producing the entire car. Would it still be sensible to buy one?  <span> <b> Jishaant Shah 9B</b></span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Recent surveys have found that producing just the battery for an electric car releases nine tonnes of CO2 emissions. At this point of the assembly line an electric car is almost 2-2.5x worse for the environment since manufacturing a car itself releases eight to 10 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. For most people, the purpose of buying an electric car is most probably to reduce CO2 emissions and limit greenhouse gases yet this defeats the purpose. If many consumers are unaware of this deceiving ploy, then why hasn’t the electric vehicle industry boomed in sales? Why isn’t every other car an electric one? 

 <p>The answer originates from the raw materials of a standard lithium battery. Lithium is the lightest metal on Earth and is the lightest solid under regular conditions, hence being fragile and difficult to transport. These extremities mean that electric vehicles are nearly impossible to mass-produce on the same scale as fossil fuel vehicles especially in Europe, because 98% of the lithium mining occurs in Australia and Latin America. Also, lithium can be very hazardous when disposed in the incorrect manner due to its electrical danger and highly flammable nature. 

 <p>The wheels of an electric vehicle turn by powering an electric motor which converts electrical energy straight into rotational energy whereas in cars powered by fuel, the fuel is combusted (burned), moving a piston which converts kinetic energy into rotational energy, resulting in a greater number of moving parts. This makes electric cars comparatively more energy efficient when placed side by side with their fossil-fuelled counterparts. In addition, a lack of moving parts reduces the chance of breakdown and in turn accounts to less spent on maintenance. Surely, if it costs less in maintenance, then electrics should be swarming UK’s roads, but clearly this not the case. Why were there only 2.2 million electric cars sold in 2019, representing just 2.5% of global car sales? 

 <p>The average transaction price for an electric vehicle (EV) is $56,437, according to Kelley Blue Book — roughly $10,000 higher than the overall industry average of $46,329 consequently the middle-class society who are willing to make a change frankly cannot afford it. This is a prominent issue seeing that an EV is equivalent to an entry-level luxury car forcing people to think twice before purchasing. In addition, charging points for EVs go hand in hand with their price since money is saved overall by avoiding fossil fuel refills and a hefty road tax. Although money is saved, time is wasted with some electric vehicles taking up to 45 minutes to charge instead of a standard two minutes for petrol- or diesel-powered vehicles. Charging points brings a second concern for drivers which is labelled as “range anxiety.” This is where the lack of trust and time in electric charging point causes fear especially when going on “long-drives.” What if everyone plugged their car into a charger when they arrived at work at 9am, or when they got home at 6pm? How will the surge in demand be dealt with? 

 <p>Hopefully, this article has made you reconsider the instinctive positive impact of electric vehicles whilst still considering it as a strong contender for your next car bearing in mind the provisional energy provided by fossil fuels forcing humanity to a more sustainable alternative.

      <h3><b>The cost-of-living crisis - The causes, climax and carnage </b></h3>
      <h5>According to the most recent Office for National Statistics (ONS) study on growing living expenses, over 25% of adults said it was already "extremely tough" or "tough" to pay their normal household expenses compared to a year ago. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) touched 9.1% in the year to May, the highest level in 40 years, according to the most recent inflation statistics, which indicate there is no end in sight to the cost-of-living crisis. <span> <b> Sam Handoo 9B</b></span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>The UK's "cost of living crisis," referring to the decline in incomes since late 2021, is primarily due to continued inflation, which is outpacing wage and welfare increases, and has been further exacerbated by recent tax rises. 

 

<p>The cost-of-living problem has numerous causes, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but there are also many additional factors that have led to the "perfect storm" affecting UK household budgets in 2022. According to British Gas: In England, mains gas heats approximately 80% of all homes, while gas power plants produce a third of the nation's electricity, hence gas is a pivotal source of energy in the UK. Several factors have given rise to the rise in gas prices. Increased gas demand from Asia, diminished gas storage capacity in Europe, unanticipated production interruptions of liquefied natural gas (LNG), and the conflict between Ukraine and Russia (a significant gas supplier to Europe) have all contributed to the steep price rises since mid-2021. These economic strains have been considerably exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Many foreign businesses have permanently stopped trading in Russia, either to comply with economic sanctions or because doing so would be risky for their reputation and many have temporarily shut down their factories in Ukraine as a result of the unstable security situation there.  

 

<p>On average, poorer households are currently suffering from higher inflation than wealthier households, making for one of the most severe issues regarding the cost-of-living crisis. Based on the percentage of budgets allocated to various broad product categories, the Institute for Fiscal Studies calculated that the annual inflation rate for the poorest 10% of households was 10.9% in April. The lowest inflation rate, at 7.9%, was experienced by the wealthiest 10% of households. This is due to the fact that energy expenses, the main cause of recent inflation, account for a larger part of low-income families’ household budgets. Even if inflation rates were comparable, the effect on poorer households may still be greater. A wealthier home might be able to withstand greater energy expenses by, for instance, reducing how much it saves, but many low-income households won't have that option. Due to this, poorer households, which are already struggling to carry the burden of energy, gas and electricity expenses are being further weighed down by the ever-increasing inflation makes for a population, suffocated by the restrictions of the economy, unable to break free from its shackles. 

 

<p>In May 2022, Rishi Sunak (the finance minister at the time) released a £15 billion package of reforms, including a non-repayable £400 energy bill grant, to help counteract the increased spike in energy prices this autumn, in order to provide support for the victims of the cost-of-living crisis.  Additionally, he stated that lump sum cash payments will be made directly to bank accounts for retirees, means-tested claimants, and recipients of disability benefits, as follows: eight million households receiving means-tested benefits will each get a £650 cash pay-out in two instalments in summer and the autumn. Pensioner households will get a cash payment of £300 via a rise in the Winter Fuel Payment. In addition, disability benefit recipients will get a cash payment of £150; some may also be eligible for the £650 payment. The Chancellor's most recent announcements have generally been welcomed, but the effects of the cost-of-living problem are increasingly apparent. According to the most recent official figures, there were 32,305 individual insolvencies reported in the first quarter of this year, which is 17% more than the same period last year and 14% more than the same quarter in 2021. 

 

<p>However, on the 5th of July, Rishi Sunak resigned. Although speculation may state otherwise, the true reason for his departure was a conflict over how to deal with the cost-of-living crisis. The anchor of the PM's strategy to demonstrate that the government is in charge of the cost-of-living situation was a joint address with the chancellor. They were unable to agree on its content. The chancellor specifically stated that the people are "ready to hear the truth" about the challenging times we face as a country. This reflects the remarks made by Mervyn King, a former governor of the Bank of England, who said that the government needed to be honest with the public about how the country has become poorer as a result of the inflation and energy crises. The cost-of-living crisis means that the government will have to make a number of incredibly challenging trade-offs in the upcoming months. The cost of providing public services is increasing for government agencies, but their monetary allocations have not yet been adjusted. If deficit is kept in check, tax cuts are guaranteed, but only after two years. New records in fuel costs have been set, but where has the budget cut of 5p gone? Since the former chancellor's cost of living package, domestic energy prices have increased considerably more than was anticipated, perhaps raising the suggestion that the government is struggling to subdue the current crisis and in turn is releasing new measures solely for the sake of veiling for what seems to be one of the mot strenuous challenges they have faced since this conservative government was initiated. 

 

<p>The cost-of-living crisis has become a primary issue, and it seems to be something of an unstoppable train that just keeps charging at the British population, however, there are some ways in which the cost-of-living crisis can be suppressed and ultimately dealt with, but they do not come without their individual drawbacks. An example of this would be windfall tax, in which  businesses’ profits, which have been enhanced by high energy prices for an example, would be subject to a one-time tax. This idea is reasonable as with oil prices at an all-time high, the petrol companies have become a “cash machine” as BP boss Bernard Looney recently stated. The combined revenue of BP, Esso and Shell alone in the first quarter was in excess of £15 billion, meaning that windfall tax on such companies would not hinder them but would also enable the eradication of a national insurance rise. However, it is preferable for businesses to put money into renewable energy instead and windfall tax would discourage investment in the North Sea as the UK works to increase its self-sufficiency. The cost-of-living crisis can and will come to an end, but the difficult decisions that will have to be made in order to end the crisis may pose extra challenges to the British population, but it is a risk that will have to be taken to stabilise the economy and in the long term to be, as Nadhim Zahawi recently said “one of the most competitive countries in the world in terms of investment.”
