      <h3><b>BORIS BLAMES ‘THE HERD’ FOR RESIGNATION. HAS HE FORGOTTEN PARTYGATE, PATERSON, AND PINCHER? </b></h3>
      <h5>Boris Johnson has officially resigned as the leader of the Conservative party, much to the relief of several prominent members of the party, and is expected to serve as Prime Minister until a new party leader is elected in autumn, <span> <b> Adam Havis 9B</b></span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>On Thursday 7th July, Boris Johnson spoke outside of 10 Downing Street to a crowd of spectators, announcing his decision to resign in the face of unprecedented mass resignations by top members of his government. </p>

<p>Just two days previously, his Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Chancellor Rishi Sunak had quit, after seeing Johnson’s appalling handling of sexual misconduct allegations against Chris Pincher. Mr Sunak stated in a letter that he "rightly expects government to be conducted properly, competently and seriously".</p>  

<p>This caused a cascade of resignations and letters of no confidence to pour in from other ministers, with many senior conservatives urging Mr Johnson himself to resign. However, the Prime Minister clung onto power, claiming that he would not give up his "colossal mandate" from the 2019 election. </p>

<p>By Thursday, more than 50 ministers had resigned, including Education Secretary Michelle Donelan, who had been appointed less than two days ago, and the government could not perform its role due to lack to staff. </p>

<p>Finally, at midday, standing at his podium, Boris Johnson resigned with a speech in which he appeared to regret nothing, clearly believing that he still has a right to remain as Prime Minister.</p> 

<p>In his speech, Mr Johnson made no mention of his previous scandals, such as his major breach of lockdown regulations, or his appointment of Chris Pincher, despite knowing of allegations of sexual misconduct against him. Instead, he blamed his own party for his downfall, comparing them to stampeding animals. “As we have seen at Westminster … when the herd moves, it moves.”, Johnson said. Nor did he express any interest in apologising, or even thanking his fellow ministers who had defended him in parliament.</p>  

<p>It is expected that while a leadership battle rages on in the conservative party, Johnson will act as “care-taker” for the nation, but even this decision is also under heavy criticism. Many leading members of parliament want Boris out of office as soon as possible, with some calling for Theresa May to return and take the role of “care-taker”. 

<p>Top contenders for the new leader of the conservatives include Rishi Sunak, the former Chancellor who became a household name after his series of plans to kick-start the economy after covid; Penny Mordaunt, the international trade minister who hasn’t been afraid to criticise Boris Johnson; and Sajid Javid, the former health secretary with a focus on integrity.</p>  

<p>Meanwhile, elsewhere in the world, there is little support for Mr Johnson. Many EU member states shared a dislike of the Prime Minister after Brexit, and they haven’t warmed up to him since. The French finance minister Bruno Le Maire has said that: “personally, I won’t miss him”, and Guy Verhofstadt, a Belgian politician, claimed that “Boris Johnson’s reign ends in disgrace”. </p> 

<p>Similarly, Joe Biden in the United States seems ready to move on, as evidence by his recent speech concerning Anglo-American relations, where he didn’t even mention Boris Johnson by name. In Russia, Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that Johnson “really does not like us – and we [do not like] him either”.   </p>

<p>It seems that after long 3 years of scandals and broken promises, the Boris Johnson era has at last drawn to a close. Only one question remains unanswered. Who will succeed him? </p>

      <h3><b>Is our rail industry going off the rails? </b></h3>
      <h5>It's no secret that Britain’s rail industry is in a state of disarray, but what really are the problems, and why is the railway so bad?<span><b>Alfie Marjoram 9B</b></span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>
	  In the first three months of this year, the Office of Rail and Road reports that 72.4 percent of trains ran on-time. As such, if you travel to work by train, five days a week, then you are likely to be delayed on three of your journeys. The report also shows that 3.9 percent of trains were cancelled, which means that, in one month of travelling to work, at least one of your trains will not operate. 

 

<p>The above statistics only hold true if the trains are actually running. Just last month, there was an entire week of major travel disruption as members of the RMT Union went on strike across the country because of disputes over pay. The strikes meant that 80 percent of trains were cancelled, and millions of people were unable to get to work. Mick Lynch, senior member of the Union, says that passengers ‘should be prepared for rail strikes to continue well into the autumn.’ 

 

<p>Unfortunately, the government is not doing much to help the industry. On 27th of June 2022, Transport for London received its fifth 'extended budget,’ worth £200 million, which ends today. As with many issues, the dispute is a matter of politics: a Conservative government disputing with the Labour Mayor of London. Yet, the government is still not providing what the company is pleading for: a long-term funding agreement. ‘We think that cutting services should be your last resort, not your first… TfL services are not at risk unless you want them to be’ says Grant Shapps, Transport Secretary for England. Despite these promises, the services are still at a huge risk if funding isn't provided again. 

 

<p>Now, what really causes a train to be delayed? The announcer might tell you it's because of a signal fault; the staff might not tell you anything, and Trainline won’t load because the Wi-Fi isn’t working. Well, statistics for 2020/21 suggest that fatalities, equipment failures, and train faults are the most common causes of delays. Network Rail say that ‘we do everything we can to prevent delays,’ but professional Twitter user Dave Smith believe that the trains are delayed on purpose. General trends show that the amount of delays is decreasing over the whole network, but there is still lots of work to be done. 

 

<p>Another problem that continues to plague the industry is major safety issues with entire fleets of trains. In April 2021, more than one hundred trains were taken out of service from LNER and GWR Intercity routes to Edinburgh, Cardiff, Cornwall, and the North. The class 800 ‘Hitachi’ trains were found to have cracks in their wheel sets, which could have led to a serious high-speed crash. Barely a year later, the Metropolitan line experienced the same problems with its trains, leading to heavily disrupted services for thousands of commuters. At least the trains aren’t crashing... 

 

<p>Well, on the 5th of July 2022 at 6:20am, two freights trains collided in Doncaster. Luckily, nobody was injured, however the incident has sparked an investigation into why trains are still colliding in the UK.  
 

<p>The industry boasts about its safety and punctuality, but should they really be bragging when a quarter of their trains don’t run on time, and when some trains are still going off the rails?
