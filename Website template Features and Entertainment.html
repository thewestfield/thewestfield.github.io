      <h3><b>How Netflix’s ‘Arcane’ Puts Itself into a League of Its Own </b></h3>
      <h5>Arcane has proven to be one of the greatest shows of all time and the best piece of media of 2021, transcending its video-game roots, <span> <b> Aahnaf Mir 9B</b></span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>With the end of lockdown, 2021 offered a healthy diet of shows: Disney+ shows like WandaVision and Loki, and Netflix shows like Squid Game and Inside Job. All good, but the output was inconsistent in quality. Many shows were publicised but did not quite hit the mark. After a constant stream of mediocrity with a few gems here and there, we finally hit the clear magnum opus of the year in November. Arcane.                                                       Before we delve into what makes the show so good, there are spoilers for Arcane in the last half of this article. You will be warned of the spoiler section when we come to it. For now, enjoy the article.                                                  Arcane is a masterpiece. With 100% on Rotten Tomatoes and 9/10 on IMDb, putting it as the 24th best TV show of all time, Arcane is shown to have a wide range of positive reception. With the presentation, characters, writing, animation, and music, it is evident that Arcane is genuinely the one of the greatest pieces of media to come out of 2021.  

<p>Despite its eventual success, the Netflix show had low expectations. It is an adaptation of the notorious League of Legends game. The video game is widely criticised due to a toxic fanbase and less than satisfactory game mechanics. Not only this but one of the central premises of the show follows the character, Jinx. League of Legends portrayed Jinx as a rip-off of Harley Quinn, not a trope usually used well. Also, Netflix has a reputation for creating horrible anime and other media adaptations. And video-game adaptations have an even worse reputation for being insulting. All-in-all, Arcane did not have any big expectations. However, it ignored these assumptions and ultimately proved them wrong.  

<p>Arcane has a simple over-arching plot; the delicate balance between the flourishing city of Piltover and the deprived city of Zaun is broken due to pleas for independence and technological advancements. The story supplies a backdrop of nuanced social commentaries that do not seem overly preachy. But Arcane is littered with other, equally essential plots. The relationship between two orphaned sisters, two intellectual characters pushing a mini-story arc, a wealthy policewoman stepping foot in both worlds, and a range of individual side characters with their own stories to explore. All these different narrative arcs are intricately made to feel real, and eventually, all lead to each other seamlessly. The only other show with similar intricacy is another fantastic show, Stranger Things, and even that is on a smaller level. All the different little plots intertwine, leading to the Arcane finale's beauty.  

<p>The best tool that Arcane utilises is its characters. A show can have incredible animation, the best plot, and the most incredible acting. Still, the show falls short if the characters are annoying or tasteless. In Arcane, the characters are the show's focus. We watch them grow and evolve as people, no character is the same by the end, and we root for every single one. Each and every character feels real, even the side characters, they each have different personalities and goals, and when they make decisions, they are not made for the sake of the plot; they are all entirely in character. Vi and Powder are the primary points of Arcane's first season, and they are wonderfully developed. We explore how the two change drastically over six years. No, these characters are not morally good, nor are the majority. But they are well-written characters who are just people trying to do what they think is best in a bad situation. You could have thought it was based on a real-world event.  

<p>Surprisingly, despite only being nine episodes, the show's production lasted six years with a budget of 90-100 million dollars. The massive budget resulted in a masterpiece with fantastic animation and perfect music. Apart from one, all the songs used in Arcane were explicitly made for the show. The music sets the tone, and the lyrics explain the plot and enhance the scene despite feeling like random songs with no connection to the show. Not all the music might be to your taste, but it adds another layer of world-building. The best scenes in the show use songs expertly to bring the scene to another level of perfection. 

<p>One main thing that sets Arcane apart from other shows is its animation. While the series' wonderfully built plot and established characters are a significant win, the animation in the series is worth the trip. It's painstakingly hand-painted and computer-animated, all framed within skilful cinematography, similar to Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse, a movie wonderfully made to look like a comic book.  


<p>Barthelemy Maunoury, Fortiche's director of animation for Arcane explains, 'the backgrounds are digitally hand-painted and the texture on the characters is crafted to get that graphical look that fits with the environment. We also mainly use 2D animation for the FXs... to reinforce the painted look. In the details it's slightly more complicated but it's... something that looks like an illustration.' You can understand the animators' effort to make the show as stunning as possible and look like literal art. Even more, is how it never looks stiff. In Arcane, the animators contribute to the incredible voice acting with the realistic facial expressions and gestures used throughout the show. The facial movements of each character are extraordinarily complex, bringing subtleties to the reaction, raw emotions to the cast's outstanding performances, and credibility to these fictional characters. 

<p>Arcane ticks all the boxes in what makes a good show: animation, music, plot and characters. Each intricately tells the beautifully made story of progression, corruption, love, dedication, and betrayal. The magnum opus of 2021 is one of the greatest shows ever. 

<p>Hopefully, this overview was enough for those who have not watched Arcane to decide to watch it, as now we are stepping foot in spoiler territory. 

<p>Hours could be spent discussing what makes Arcane the most significant work of 2021. From the slick editing to the incredible vocal performances and the subtle symbolism that pushes the plot. However, to keep me from pointless rambling, the focus will be on what Arcane does best: its mastery of visual storytelling.  

<p>In media, how information and meaning are conveyed to the audience is extremely important. Arcane, as mentioned before, uses animation, a medium that can share meaning better than any other. Arcane follows the principle of 'Show, don't Tell' and manages to tread that fine line between exposition dumps and plain confusion. These factors give the animators a broad scope to communicate information quickly and subtly.  

<p>Foreshadowing is a tool that makes a show entertaining and moves the narrative along but is often misused. Arcane, however, does not shy away from foreshadowing and rewards the audience for noticing them with satisfying payoffs. 

<p>One of the show's most gratifying forms of foreshadowing is centred around the intellectual Viktor. In episode 6, we flashback to a much younger Viktor playing with a makeshift toy boat in the undercity. It runs down a small stream, and he chases after it, failing due to his ailment. Two episodes later, we see him bind himself to Hextech, healing his injured leg. To demonstrate this, he takes off down a pier in a shot that is a work of pure art. This time, he not only kept pace with a much bigger boat in the background but outpaced it. It gives the scene a much more significant emotional punch as we see Viktor overcome his illnesses. We see the potential of the Hexcore before being given devastating consequences. 

<p>Some wallpaper materialAnother example of animation used to compliment a character is the use of green in relation to Ekko.  Throughout Acts 2 and 3, Ekko is associated with hope and healing, gaining the title ‘The Boy Saviour’. He is the only character to focus on the present. All characters are either haunted by their past or ambitious for the future, but Ekko breaks this mould. He focuses on making the now better, creating a haven full of greenery, the only greenery we ever see in the Undercity. Furthermore, his 'gang' is called the 'Firelights', named after a creature unique to the show. The little insect glows bright green, another connection to growth and hope. Finally, his hoverboard leaves behind a green trail, symbolising the hope he leaves behind hope for the Undercity to grow, to evolve into a better place. *shayan note  -----> ‘the boy saviour’ 

<p>Arcane has so many exquisitely executed visual metaphors due to the level of visual care present throughout the series that it would be near impossible to cover them all. So, the focus will be on what is the most visually stunning of them all: the biblical death scene of Powder.  

<p>The death of Powder is a metaphor for the death of who she was and will be. When Powder blows up the warehouse, she is blown backwards at the end of Act 1. We get this gorgeous wide shot as she falls to the ground, almost biblical in its appearance, another jaw-dropping frame. She looks peaceful now; she has achieved her goal of saving her family. But in reality, this is the last time we see her as Powder and the first we see of Jinx. This beautiful shot directly parallels another integral character's scene in the series. Silco's death and rebirth in the ocean. The death at the hands of his 'brother', Vander, and the rebirth of a new man, a man to be feared and powerful. This is an ideology Silco instils in Jinx, empathising with her feelings of betrayal. 

<p>I hope you enjoyed this dip into Arcane. There is still so much more to say despite the last three pages, so you can imagine the excellency of Arcane. It is inexpressible how well made this show is, and needless to say, I am looking forward to season 2. </p>

      <h3><b>Blackpink comeback and world tour? BTS on hiatus?</b></h3>
      <h5>On July 6 it was announced by their record label YG Entertainment, that Blackpink 'are in the final stages of recording a new album', and that they are working on 'a continuous large-scale project which will extend through the second half of the year.'<span> <b> Adrian Baptista 9B</b></span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Not only that, but their agency announced that they “will also go on the largest world tour in the history of a K-pop girl group by the end of the year.” This upcoming world tour will be their second since 2020.  

  

  <p>Blackpink’s last album release was back in October 2020, with many of its songs and the album itself placing high on the charts. But since then, the group has been on hiatus. Despite the pause in group activities, members Rosé and Lisa have been focusing on their own solo debut albums. As well as this, the members also did fashion work with different brands.  

  

  <p>Their two-year-long break means they now have the title of the K-pop group with the longest hiatus in their generation. This caused many to joke that Blackpink always breaks records and becomes number one, even when it comes to the longest period without releasing music.   

  

  <p>The album is set to release in August but no dates for the tour have been announced. However, fans are already buzzing about the news, with posts on social media filled with their excitement for what they expect to be an amazing comeback that will break more positive records.   

  

  <p>On the other hand, days after the release of their anthology album ‘Proof,’ BTS announced during their ninth-anniversary dinner, which was posted on YouTube on June 14th, that they would be taking a break from group activities to refocus on their identities so they could return stronger as a group.   

  

  <p>The group have been extremely successful in recent years and have gained lots of popularity with fans all over the globe. However, BTS explained that they needed this break as they felt “exhausted” with no time to grow as a group or as individuals. Some were worried that this hiatus would go the same way as other globally recognized groups in the past such as One Direction, who announced a hiatus and never returned.   

  

  <p>However, BTS’s management company, HYBE Entertainment, clarified that this was not a hiatus, in order to avoid the negative connotations tied with the word, but that it was merely just a “temporary break,” and that the artists would focus instead on their solo endeavours. The BTS members themselves have also told their fans not to “see this as a negative thing,” and reassured them that they will return. BTS member SUGA explained, “It’s not that we’re disbanding - we’re just living apart for a while.”  

  

  <p>Since then, the members have started working on their own projects. Most notably, on the 24th of June, Jungkook was featured in Charlie Puth’s song, ‘Left and Right’ that went on to place high in the Billboard charts. In addition, J-Hope released a music video for his song ‘More’ that will be part of his new solo album ‘Jack in the Box,’ coming out on July 19th.  

  

  <p>While BTS is taking their well-deserved break, fans wish them luck and excitedly wait for BTS’s “second chapter” for they promised them in their latest song, that their “best moment is yet to come.”

      <h3><b>THE AGE OF ANIMATION </b></h3>
      <h5>When asked for one’s preferred genre, one could give many answers but the most recurrent response is animation. However, although the majority may regard it as a genre, this is simply is not true; it is not a genre but a way of modern media, an expression of one’s artistic ability, creative talent, vibrant and vivid story-telling and wholesome stories,  <span> <b> Shayan Sabeshan 9B</b></span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>From its very emergence at the dawn of the 20th century, the simple expression of animation has wandered out into a world of its own, and it has become even more pertinent than ever with our age of animation.  </p>

<h5>ISLE OF DOGS: </h5>

<p>Wes Anderson is very much well known for being one of the most eccentric and whimsical directors of modern cinema, with one of the most impressive and immaculate roster of films, not limited to: The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and The Darjeeling Limited. Despite his extraordinary track record, he is hugely acclaimed for his work in the realm of stop motion animation, most notably with 2018’s Isle of Dogs. A film that encompasses Anderson’s classic and immediately recognisable charm making it seem almost effortless, whilst being what was most likely the most strenuous and tortuous project Anderson had ever worked on. A wondrous and rewarding tale of companionship, devotion and culture: This is Isle of Dogs.  

<p>The story begins in the futuristic Japanese city of Megasaki, where following an outbreak of dog-flu, Mayor Kobayashi calls for all dogs to be hastily expelled to Trash Island, later renamed the Isle of Dogs. Mayor Kobayashi’s 12 year old orphaned nephew and ward, Atari, escapes to the Isle in search of his lost dog, Spots. He comes upon a pack of nomadic, yet empathetic dogs led by Bryan Cranston’s Chief as they journey the island whilst being pursued by the corrupt forces of Megasaki. 

<p>Chief’s character is one born out of abandonment and solitude; one that was meant to live and die in isolation, a character incapable of change. Yet it soon come to be that Chief was indeed capable of change and the catalyst of such change was Atari – ‘The Little Pilot’. Following Atari’s descent upon the Isle, Chief awaited his awakening and following so, and attended to Atari’s instructions the best he could. Of all on the Isle, no one quite understood the ache of forlornness as vividly as he did; despite all that the people of Megasaki had done, he was willing to throw it all aside to succour Atari with his quest of retrieving Spots.  

<p>The animation of Isle of Dogs is simply breath-taking and not without the effort of the tireless and creative minds of the film. Over 1,000 unique characters with thousands of various sculpted faces with distinct expressions – each painstakingly crafted by hand; the highest amount of hand sculpted figures for a stop motion film. One distinctive quirk of the animation was the ripple-effect and rougher animation aesthetic on the hair of the characters, following Anderson’s demand that real animal hair be used for all the characters; despite the criticism provided by the other creative minds, Anderson’s nostalgia towards 1933’s King Kong gave him a sizeable appreciation for a rougher sort of animation, believing it gave a distinctive visual signature to the animation. Another certain visual motif is the Anderson’s use of illusory planimetric composition, otherwise known as the ‘unreality of flatness’ with more fanciful themes and diversion from the generic ‘modus operandi’ of naturalism, the ‘attempt to create a believable illusion representative of reality.’ 

<p>The world-building of Megasaki and the Isle are absolutely phenomenal with inspirations branching outwards through different eras and the significant impacts of Japan’s history most notably Akira Kurosawa’s striking visual flair and architectural influence of the Tokugawa Period (1603 – 1867). From their countless schemes and concepts, a surplus of 240 micro sets were cumbrously created with such intricately artistic compositions with warm, beautifully and meticulous, symmetric backdrops; the kind that radiates Anderson’s eloquent approach to film-making. </p>

<h5>GRAVITY FALLS:</h5> 

<p>Though the towering animation empire of Disney may be more recognised for its highly influential films of the Silver Age or its extraordinary feats made during its Renaissance era, many have collectively agreed on the eminence and genius behind Gravity Falls. A show that stuck true to its promise of ‘quality over quantity’ with a show-run consisting of only 2 seasons, each with 20 episodes, yet with a near stellar cast of characters with devised and knotty backstories, weird and off-beat personalities and even further entangled relationships. A show that brought forth novel and enthralling concepts that inspired the conception of many of the greatest animated shows in recent history: This is Gravity Falls. 

<p>Gravity Falls follows the Pine twins, Dipper and Mabel, as they navigate their way through the summer with their Great-Uncle Stan in the mysterious town of Gravity Falls and begin to uncover the madness, chaos and mystery surrounding the little and quaint town. 

<p>Dipper and Mabel share such involved ties with one another that it seems almost impossible to encapsulate their relationship in such a cramped article. Their personality traits work extremely well together, which is a given as they were written to do so, however the way that it is portrayed makes it seem that much more natural; Dipper being the one with the academic prowess, the awkward and socially stunted brother and his sister Mabel, more of a brighter and bubbly character, a kind-hearted sister who relishes each and every moment she spends with those she loves. The story they are forced into gives them a true perspective into how deeply they care for each other; acting as an optimistic mirror of the once-strained relationship between two of the other protagonists of the series: their Great Uncles – Stanley and Stanford. At its heart, the show is a wholesome tale of a sincere love between a brother and a sister and what it means to be a family. 

<p>Quite clearly the highlight of the show, the villain – the treacherous and perilous trans-dimensional demon, who carries the name of Bill Cipher. One of the most truly omnipotent and all-knowing beings in fictional history with an almost perfectly suited disposition for both the story and the characters within. Chaotic, conniving and maniacal in nature, a devious and sadistic trickster and a demon with the attributes paralleling that of a God, even capable of annihilating the physical manifestation of time in one fell swoop. Bill’s uncontested in wit, deviousness and potency and his mastery and dominion over all life gave him a presence as one of the more threatening antagonists in recent time, giving us, the audience, every more of a reason to side with our protagonists.  

<p>Bill’s iconic appearance is well-known and for good reason; Bill’s obvious inspiration being the Eye of Providence, the all-seeing eye whereby God surveys all which illustrates Bill as a figure of utmost authority and divinity. Bill’s bright lemon hue though suggesting warmth and happiness, was chosen as a façade, a mask to which Bill was to cower behind, tortured by his grievous acts of the past. For the entirety of his life and even in the event leading to his end, Bill had failed to understand what it meant to feel truly ‘human’. Despite knowing the mysteries and inner workings of our reality, jeering at humanity’s fatal flaws, he failed to recognise his own fatal flaw – his lack of humanity and misunderstanding of what it meant to be human; something that Dipper and Mabel had come to embrace – ‘being human.’

      <h3><b>THE TALE OF TECHNOBLADE  </b></h3>
      <h5>Technoblade. The name rings familiar to many people around the globe, more now than ever and for good reason. A renowned youtuber and the man credited as ‘The Best Minecraft Player alive.’,<span> <b> Shayan Sabeshan 9B</b></span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p> For many months until now, it seemed that Technoblade’s channel was becoming increasingly inactive by the day and his channel, barren of any new content or videos to the public, following his diagnosis of Sarcoma, a rare type of cancer. Then came the 1st of July, where a long awaited video was uploaded on the platform, entitled ‘So Long Nerds.’ Yet, as many soon came to realise, Technoblade was nowhere to be seen and all that could be seen was a man and what appeared to be Technoblade’s dog sitting quietly in a room. The man introduced himself as the father of Technoblade and read out a prepared letter on behalf of his son ‘Hello everyone. Technoblade here. If you’re watching this, I’m dead.’ A statement that all those who had known Technoblade had dreaded to hear. A statement that the brought the community together. A statement that ended the Tale of Technoblade. 

<p>Technoblade, or otherwise known, from the recent revelation in his post-mortem video, as his birth name Alex, began as a young, dedicated creator and despite knowing what little impact his poorly edited videos had on the platform, his attitude towards what seemed to be certain failure never seemed to waver and every view he earned, he coveted and cherished. 

<p>What set Technoblade apart from the roster of YouTube’s creators? Even following the decline of Minecraft’s popularity, Technoblade persevered through the trying times still regularly releasing capital and high quality content, whilst his channel undertook a newfound popularity and status within the community. His unique and distinct comedic talent, composed of his unparalleled story-telling, ‘good-natured humility’ and ‘self-deprecating wit’, was one that was set apart from the majority of creators on the platform. Secondly, his respect and unwavering loyalty towards his followers, gradually building up and creating one of the most beloved and eccentric communities on YouTube, with those who mutually respected and cared for each other and shared a communal enjoyment over Technoblade’s content. Finally, his more outlandish, bizarre and quirky content that gifted him a spot as one of the most driven and yet, whimsical creators out there.  

<p>What was his legacy? Even through his tiring treatment, a choice was made by Technoblade – he would persist and send his viewers off on a high note and do the absolute best he could for the community with what minimal time he had left. Even in his final hours, he willingly decided to write the script that his father was to read, a mere 8 hours before his death. All to ensure that his devoted followers would be given as much closure as they could receive and that they would be fine, even after his death. His death sparked the re-emergence of many mostly inactive members of the community, brought together his friends and family, and the news spread like wildfire across the globe, featuring on many of the world’s foremost news channels. Not only the Minecraft community, but communities all across the Internet came together through social media to grieve the death of Technoblade. Communities, full of artists and animators so dedicated to their craft as Techno was, producing all sorts of prodigious and marvellous artwork and a myriad of inspired and talented players built towering monuments to Techno and thousands of celebrities shared their heartfelt tributes and gave their condolences to Technoblade. To Alex. All of whom, sharing that he would never be forgotten and that ‘Technoblade Never Dies!’

      <h3><b>‘THE FALL OF MEDIA’ </b></h3>
      <h5>If I said that the mainstream is slowly becoming the anti-mainstream, what would that mean to you? For those that are still reading, go to the supplement to read about Minions: Rise of Gru, <span><b>Rudraksh Gangooly 9B</b></span></h5>

      <p>
	  If I said that the mainstream is slowly becoming the anti-mainstream, what would that mean to you? For those that are still reading, go to the supplement to read about Minions: Rise of Gru.  Over the past few years, the oversaturation of media and entertainment has blindsided the implementation of art into popular culture. If I were to tell you that Minions: Rise of Gru deftly marries the bleak, unrelenting tone of its source material with a daring theatrical direction, contrasting with the sprawling epics of thespian hysteria drenched in neon haze of the recent days, with a film of current masterpiece status with little to prove, but enough to satisfy its diehard fans, and welcoming new ones into its cult-like following, would you believe me? Would you take this writer’s words as gospel or satire?  

<p>The truth is, the words of this article will likely be glossed over in the grand scheme of attempts at catering to the generalised animalistic impulses of familiarity through assertions of popular culture.  Whereas the concept of entertainment was once the tinder to a novel landscape of talent, raw human greed has once again found a path to exploit the serotonin, the dopamine and the endorphins for nothing but what a nihilist would see as numbers, numbers in the amount of ineffectual material items, numbers on an ATM machine. Without deterioration into increasingly economical phrasings of our own bleak, self-perpetuating nature of grasping at any chance for our own ambition, whether it be assets or power, and whether it ultimately is at the cost of the sacrifice of others, the world of 'entertainment' or the process of making use of the potential of our conscious' decomposition in response to specifically chemically-engineered content dry will never fade, and will sooner or later never decease, as without our leading figures that one would never see as deceiving or misguiding due to conditioning of loyalty and reliance to the over-arching system from birth, one may have to finally ask themselves whether we live in an artificial world, one where entities of scale far beyond human conception in these numbers that are slowly doubted more and more take every opportunity to capitalise on the vulnerabilities of our own psyche, the psyche capable of tuning out the noise of our ponderous self-inflicted end, and the noise that distracts us from it, which is the noise we will never tune out. 

<p>These traps set out for the public come in many forms. The rise of TikTok has begun to eat away at the attention spans of its young userbase, due to its infinite and addictive nature. As Netflix and other streaming services rapidly grow in expansion across the planet, the pace at which we consume entertainment grows, leaving a growing void of content that must be fully financed and produced at breakneck speeds to satisfy the billions that engage in this culture where the quality of product slowly decreases over time. This brooding consumerism that surrounds media is ever-present and inescapable, your favourite artist will have lines upon lines of merchandise to near-extortionate prices, as the corporate pawns use the average consumer’s lust for what they see as support as the sponsors to their conglomerates. As the standards to satisfying the hyper-active and sensitive minds of children slowly drop over the years from dedicated TV channels (Further reading: Gravity Falls - Shayan Sabeshan) to YouTube videos of industrialised, inane sequences of low-budget animation constructed by an algorithm assessing whatever intellectual properties a child will recognise, often delving into a surreal and inhuman environment, we can only assume the same will happen for the general public as well. Thankfully, a shining beacon in the murky depths of stationary leisure has appeared, in the form of Minions: Rise of Gru, a movie that those of all ages can enjoy. A multi-faceted epic of grand ambition and stunning scope, Minions: Rise of Gru delivers on practically every possible criticism a film like this could face and excels beyond the current standards and boundaries for art in general. And just like how you wouldn’t expect a quick advertisement in the middle of an article criticising the very thing being advertised, the possibilities for monetising every aspect of our lives becomes unpredictable and expands with greater knowledge of human susceptibilities able to be capitalised on.  

<p>With every waking moment, descending into an abyss of a dystopian life becomes more imminent, as more and more of our lives are spent on purely consuming entertainment and a deficit of creative and innovative energy grows. Looking at the 50 highest-grossing films of all time, the current trend of marketability concerns family-friendly blockbusters (with the sole exception of Joker, albeit being from a comic book trademark) produced by a few megalithic corporations again pandering to the people, even if in a less blunt and forwardly extreme method than social media. Social media has been engineered to become the dream of the indolent. With no method of age verification being implemented into these hyper-addictive programs, each generation experiences the lure of constant exposure to the virtual world thriving alongside ours earlier, being rooted deeper into the lives of these very children. 

<p>Gaining insecurity through means of viewing what is presented as the intrinsic basics to one's life via an interface designed to connect, but now is purely used to serve those tenets of cognitive exploitation, is a dangerous game, a game only seen as intrinsic when viewed through the myopic lens of this central indolent that falls in every trap set out for them. But the worst factor being that this indolent is very much aware that he is actively participating in this game but does absolutely nothing to bring himself to face the consequences of what he thinks are rudimentary and eventually meaningless actions, because after all, he is just one of 4.62 billion people connected to the manufactured hivemind for 2 hours and 27 minutes a day. The neurochemical drama of day-to-day life should not be used for capital gain, but nevertheless this system will outlive every person after they die, just multiplying into new forms to adapt to the new levels of extortion that humanity can pull off successfully without any thought of the impact it will have on the future generations. And just like all things have a narrative exactly like a song, a TV show or a movie, they will all have a beginning and an end, but for social media, the end will only occur when the sprawling complexity of the human intellect has entirely diminished, giving this concept a parasitic and destructive lifespan. And now, we are seeing the end of entertainment as we know it now. 

<p>However, the antidote to oversaturation is popularising the antithesis of the ever-popular archetype. In this way, the mainstream is ever-changing and always shifting as radicalism becomes borderline-revolutionary. And as we finally begin to wind down from almost 200-word sentences approaching the style of a purposefully over-sophisticated philosophical manifesto, there may still be uncertainty to whether this was actually a parody of an arrogant and fundamentally egotistically written broadsheet article (hint) or whether anything I mentioned was really taking place. After all, this is all conceptual. But with one last point, viewing the Netflix Top 10 (a system showing the 10 most viewed shows or movies of the day) shows that the consumers tend to favour reality TV more, a more intellectually numb form of entertainment relying on that same method of catering to human impulses with low-stakes drama just like social media. And the same is happening across the board in the world of entertainment. The Spotify Top 50 Songs chart displays dozens upon dozens of commercialised pop songs produced for radio play, written by a dozen record company executives around a table on the top floor of a New York skyscraper trying to wrap their heads around a bar chart of modern trends on a PowerPoint, each having signed a dozen artists completely stripped of artistic value or potential. But the first song, the highest-charting, the most popular song, is different. This is 'Running Up That Hill' by Kate Bush.  

<p>The song has been made popular by the recent season of Stranger Things, released just a few weeks prior to the newspaper's release, but the song itself is from 1985. And it is crushing for this new industry, because amongst all of these attempts to engineer songs that will get the most streams or downloads, the song that beats them all is one from 37 years ago. And it's also quite fitting, as it's the only song on that list to be from the era which is the inverse of everything I have talked about for the past 3 pages, almost as if the only way to gain true, unbridled popularity in the modern age is to look to the past. And this was when the rot of consumerism had not yet settled in to this industry just yet, almost as if it was a wake-up alarm to those dozen executives sitting around that table that their audience was capable of appreciating something other than what has been specifically manufactured for them to enjoy and invest in, because all their audience ever wanted was something that was just unapologetically music for the sake of music, something honest in a dishonest world, something that had the capability to make a resurgence decades after its creation, because finally, after everything that tore media apart, the mainstream went against itself once again, the most popular thing being the opposite of everything popular that came directly before it. And that is quite a beautiful thought, really.
