      <h3><b>HOW TIKTOK COULD BE SPYING ON YOU  </b></h3>
      <h5>In 2020, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused TikTok of illegally sending user data to the Chinese government and in a media interview he stated that “It’s not possible to have your personal information flow across a Chinese server, without that data ending up in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party”,<span> <b> James Plaw 9B</b></span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>TikTok has denied these accusations but recently pressure has been put on the social media site once again as The FCC Commissioner Brenden Carr tweeted his request for Apple and Google to remove the video-sharing platform from their app stores. 

  

<p>The Commissioner also wrote a letter to the companies stating how TikTok poses a national security risk. 

<p>TikTok’s privacy policy even states that it collects search and browsing history, facial ID, voice prints, texts, location and photos. 

<p>Members of the US and UK public have begun to uninstall the app as they are afraid of their data getting into the hands of the Chinese government. 

<p>As of late there have also been supposed leaked audio files from internal TikTok meetings which stated that China-based employees had access to data which ByteDance (the company which own TikTok) had formerly claimed was stored in the US. In one meeting in September 2021 a member of the TikTok Trust and Safety Department said that “Everything is seen in China”. TikTok spokesperson Maureen Shanahan responded with a statement saying that they will “aim to remove any doubt about the security of US user data. That's why we hire experts in their fields, continually work to validate our security standards, and bring in reputable, independent third parties to test our defences." 

<p>If  you would like to make sure that your data is not being shared then, I suggest you delete the app from your phone or you could use a VPN which provides a layer of protection between your devices and the internet as it hides your IP address and encrypts your data. 

<p>Some countries such as India, Pakistan, Afgahnistan, Indonesia and Bangladesh have already gone to the extent of banning TikTok completely to attempt to clamp down on the amount of data being shared to other governments. In 2020, US President Donald Trump had intentions to ban TikTok after signing executive orders which declared the app as a threat to national security but in the end the app was not banned by the former president. 

<p>However, TikTok is not the only site to have been accused of sharing data as US social media platforms Facebook and Instagram have also experienced such accusations which they have denied. 

<p>There is a common misconception that these platforms are illegally stealing your data in order to tailor adverts relevant to you but this is not the entire truth. In the privacy policies, which most people blindly agree to, these platforms are given permission to access your data which can allow them to use it in ways which you may oppose. 

<p>Will you still allow this to happen to you?

      <h3><b>‘GENTLEMINIONS’ BANNED FROM MANY CINEMAS NATIONWIDE </b></h3>
      <h5>As you may have seen, the recent animated film ‘Minions: Rise of Gru’ has just been released in cinemas across the nation on 1st July and after a 5-year wait from the previous ‘Minions’ film in 2015, many Minions fans were left painfully waiting for this release,<span> <b>Shivam Patel 9B</b></span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p> Within its four first days of release, it had gained over $200 million (£16,826,000) at the box office, with its filming budget being $80-85 million (£67,304,000-£71,510,500). However, this has not been solely due to the grand interest in the Minions itself, but mainly due to the film ‘blowing up’ all over social media, especially the application ‘TikTok’. The so-called ‘#Gentleminions’ trend is all behind this huge success, but what actually is it?  

<p>The Gentleminions trend entails of acquiring a good, smart suit, finding several friends who are prepared to do the same, and walking boldly into a Rise of Gru screening, according to popular TikTok videos. It continues to be ludicrous. Others joined a group of people kneeling to a Minion mascot outside a movie, while some sneaked in bushels of bananas. As a result of the videos not being grouped together by a single TikTok sound or hashtag, it is difficult to estimate the exact number of people who have joined the trend. Many videos feature the rapper Yeat’s song ‘Rich Minion’, which is said to have partially initiated this uproar. 28 million people have seen TikTok's that contain the hashtag #Gentleminions in them, as of 12th July and this continues to rapidly increase each day. PostTrak, a company that conducts exit polls, found that 34% of moviegoers during the film's opening weekend were between the ages of 13 and 17 and mainly ‘Gen Z’, in comparison to the 8% of the 13–17-year-old audience for the film ‘Despicable Me 3’. Yet, what seems to be an innocent, harmless and childish trend on social media has started to cause disruption within numerous cinemas throughout the United Kingdom.   

<p>Several popular chain cinemas, like the 'Odeon’ and ‘Cineworld’ have resorted, out of frustration, to placing posters and signs indicating that they will “turn away anyone wearing a suit with tickets to Minions” and smaller cinemas have continued to do the same, as seen with the tweet, only one day after its release, from Regal Cinema Wadebridge (Cornwall), indicating that “We are currently not admitting unaccompanied children wearing suits for ‘Minions: The Rise of Gru’ (U). This is due to the issues we have encountered over the last 2 days and its associated behaviour.” A parent informed the Mansfield Chad that two boys in his 13-year-old son's group who were only wearing white collared shirts had also been subject to the prohibition against teenagers wearing suits. According to reports, they were sent away from their scheduled screening until parents could arrive with a few jumpers to conceal the offending pieces of formal attire.  

<p>The inside joke has also cost theatres money, with recent reports claiming that several have lost money by refunding tickets to families that attended. According to the manager of a Vue Cinema in Worcester, client complaints over the alleged "Gentleminions" drove him to give refunds of £1,300 in only one day.  

<p>On the contrary, other moviegoers greatly appreciated the ‘#gentleminions' behaviour throughout their showings. The group was "so much fun" and "very well-behaved," said Stace Woods, a teaching assistant from Surrey, on social media. She added that they respectfully stopped worshipping a huge Gru poster so that her kids could have a picture with it.  

<p>Having said that, this has not been the first time that this has happened through social media. According to The Face, there is a huge ‘meme’ subculture around The Rise of Gru that is comparable to that of the superhero movie ‘Morbius’, which was released earlier in 2022. Both ‘meme’ subcultures centred on a largely ironic appreciation for the presumed strengths of the mentioned film, frequently bordering on the absurdist, but The Face noted that The Rise of Gru's interest was largely based on genuine interest in the movie, whereas Morbius' interest was purely based on the perceived lack of professionalism and quality of the production.  

<p>Thus, although the ‘#Gentleminion’ trend has died down a little since its peak at around the 2-5 July, it has still proved to have caused large disruptions within many cinemas nationwide, with several banning youth in suits to its showing, leading us to the ultimate question, when will ‘Gen Z’ strike next?

      <h3><b>THE RISE OF YOUTUBE  </b></h3>
      <h5>YouTube has become one of the most renowned social media sites in its seventeen-year history, falling short on active users only to Facebook. The video-sharing platform has gained popularity as a hub to watch and upload videos, with content spanning all interests and people. It has had a significant cultural impact, influencing pop culture, and creating worldwide internet trends. This article will explore the history of the platform and figures who have made their name on it,<span> <b> William Howard  & James Plaw 9B</b></span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>YouTube was created on the 14th February 2005 by Jawed Karim, Chad Hurley, and Steve Chen. The first ever video uploaded on to the site was a video by Jawed himself, uploaded on the 24th April 2005. Jawed starred in the rather straightforward video titled “Me at the zoo” which has recorded more than 237,000,000 views and 12 million likes to date, an initial landmark in the history of YouTube. Fortunately, the diversity and quality of content has greatly evolved from this first video. Videos exist for almost any searchable keyword and videos have gone from 30-second home clips to highly produced videos lasting up to hours. 

 

<p>In the early days of YouTube, the channel “Smosh” gained popularity, being the most subscribed-to channel for a period in 2006, from April 2007 to September 2008 as well as a brief stint in 2013, but they remained around the top five for a decade. Their content mainly involves comedy sketches and in 2002, Anthony Padilla founded “smosh.com” to upload flash animations and was later joined by Ian Hecox. They started in Autumn 2005 and took YouTube by storm quickly becoming one of the biggest channels. In 2012 they diversified their content to include multiple channels in different languages and on different content, with channels “Smosh Pit” and “Smosh Games” created. Padilla ended up leaving “Smosh” in 2017 and in 2018 the parent company “Defy Media” shut down. Therefore, the following year they joined “Mythical Entertainment” and are still creating content to this day and continuing to expand their enterprises, creating a Twitch channel in 2020. Whilst they are no longer on top of the platform it is undeniable that they assisted in growing the platform at the start of its life and paved the way for the larger creators which followed in their footsteps such as the creator in the following paragraph, “PewDiePie” As of the 13th of July 2022, they have 25 million subscribers which, astoundingly, is only around 9000th on the platform, showing its immense growth; even 9 years ago that would have been by far the most. 

<p>In 2010, the YouTube channel “PewDiePie” was created by Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg. In the early days of the channel Felix uploaded videos of him playing action games such as Minecraft, Call of Duty, and Amnesia: The Dark Descent. In 2011 the Swede started to upload weekly vlogs called “Fridays with PewDiePie”. At this point PewDiePie had earned himself a reasonable following of 60,000 subscribers but this was nothing compared to what was to come. The channel continued to grow in popularity rapidly and less than a year later than hitting the 60,000-subscriber mark, PewDiePie had gained hundreds of thousands of subscribers. After speaking at the Nonick conference in 2012 PewDiePie’s popularity skyrocketed and just 4 months later than having 500,000 subscribers, PewDiePie had 2 million. Through late 2012 and early 2013 PewDiePie continued to grow in popularity and on the 15 August 2013 PewDiePie surpassed “Smosh” in subscribers and became the most subscribed channel in the world. Felix received a Guiness World Record for having the most subscribers. PewDiePie led the subscriber charts for 4 years until Indian record label “T-series” surpassed the channel in February 2017.In August 2019 PewDiePie became the first ever individual to reach 100 million subscribers and received a Red Diamond Play Button for this feat. However, PewDiePie was not the first channel ever to reach 100 million subscribers as T-series reached the mark just a few months earlier. 

<p>Over the last few years YouTube has been taken over by corporations, specifically ‘T-Series’ and “Cocomelon.” These companies overtook “PewDiePie” in the past few years and are the first and second most subscribed to channels, respectively. “SET India” (owned by Sony) is also rapidly catching up to “Cocomelon” which would cement two Indian corporations as the first and second most subscribed to, which is unsurprising when the population India is well over a billion. T-Series is a Music record label and film production company founded by Gulshan Kumar in 1983, joining YouTube in 2006 but not uploading till 2010 but it exploded in popularity in 2018 and it became the first channel to hit 100 million subscribers, much to the disappointment of “PewDiePie” who made a “diss track” on them and sarcastic video on them surpassing him in subscribers titled “Congratulations”, which involved lyrics such as “India got YouTube figured out, that's sick, son How 'bout next you figure how to fix the caste system?”. T-Series have over 380 million across all their channel, primarily producing content in Hindi. They are undisputedly the largest channel and do not look like being overtaken any time soon. Another of the large corporations is Cocomelon who are on a similar subscriber count to “SET India.” Cocomelon  is an American YouTube channel and streaming media show. They were originally acquired by Moonbug entertainment who are a British company, and they were maintained by an American company called “Treasure Studios.” Their videos are aimed towards a younger audience as they produce nursery rhymes with animations, and they were also added to Netflix and Hulu, displaying the size of the channel. It is worth mentioning also, the channels of famous musicians such as “Justin Bieber,” “Marshmello” and “Eminem” appearing in the top thirty. YouTube is used to share their music videos and to expand their audience. This is the reason that businesses may join YouTube and across all social media platforms, they can be used to lead people to their official website and to gain fame. In addition to having their own channels, businesses can also make advertisements for a similar purpose which can help to grow their business by introducing their products or service to a wider audience. 

<p>The most viewed video on YouTube was uploaded on the 18th of June 2016 by “Pinkfong” a channel which uploads songs and stories for children. The video titled “Baby Shark” has been viewed almost 11 billion times which is more than any other video on the platform. The video went viral in the Western World in 2018 with adults and children uploading videos of themselves dancing to the song. The channel has since reached 50 million subscribers and continues to upload songs and stories for children. 

 

<p>YouTube has become extremely successful as a social media platform and has revolutionised the internet. It has become so successful that it has no competition and stands alone as the site to upload and discover videos, whilst simultaneously creating livelihoods and generating copious amounts of income, twenty-eight million, eight hundred thousand dollars in 2021 alone. It has pioneered the age of social media along with Facebook, and it is difficult to imagine a world without such a useful service for the 2.3 billion users across the world.

      <h3><b>THE TALE OF TECHNOBLADE  </b></h3>
      <h5>Technoblade. The name rings familiar to many people around the globe, more now than ever and for good reason. A renowned youtuber and the man credited as ‘The Best Minecraft Player alive.’,<span> <b> Shayan Sabeshan 9B</b></span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p> For many months until now, it seemed that Technoblade’s channel was becoming increasingly inactive by the day and his channel, barren of any new content or videos to the public, following his diagnosis of Sarcoma, a rare type of cancer. Then came the 1st of July, where a long awaited video was uploaded on the platform, entitled ‘So Long Nerds.’ Yet, as many soon came to realise, Technoblade was nowhere to be seen and all that could be seen was a man and what appeared to be Technoblade’s dog sitting quietly in a room. The man introduced himself as the father of Technoblade and read out a prepared letter on behalf of his son ‘Hello everyone. Technoblade here. If you’re watching this, I’m dead.’ A statement that all those who had known Technoblade had dreaded to hear. A statement that the brought the community together. A statement that ended the Tale of Technoblade. 

<p>Technoblade, or otherwise known, from the recent revelation in his post-mortem video, as his birth name Alex, began as a young, dedicated creator and despite knowing what little impact his poorly edited videos had on the platform, his attitude towards what seemed to be certain failure never seemed to waver and every view he earned, he coveted and cherished. 

<p>What set Technoblade apart from the roster of YouTube’s creators? Even following the decline of Minecraft’s popularity, Technoblade persevered through the trying times still regularly releasing capital and high quality content, whilst his channel undertook a newfound popularity and status within the community. His unique and distinct comedic talent, composed of his unparalleled story-telling, ‘good-natured humility’ and ‘self-deprecating wit’, was one that was set apart from the majority of creators on the platform. Secondly, his respect and unwavering loyalty towards his followers, gradually building up and creating one of the most beloved and eccentric communities on YouTube, with those who mutually respected and cared for each other and shared a communal enjoyment over Technoblade’s content. Finally, his more outlandish, bizarre and quirky content that gifted him a spot as one of the most driven and yet, whimsical creators out there.  

<p>What was his legacy? Even through his tiring treatment, a choice was made by Technoblade – he would persist and send his viewers off on a high note and do the absolute best he could for the community with what minimal time he had left. Even in his final hours, he willingly decided to write the script that his father was to read, a mere 8 hours before his death. All to ensure that his devoted followers would be given as much closure as they could receive and that they would be fine, even after his death. His death sparked the re-emergence of many mostly inactive members of the community, brought together his friends and family, and the news spread like wildfire across the globe, featuring on many of the world’s foremost news channels. Not only the Minecraft community, but communities all across the Internet came together through social media to grieve the death of Technoblade. Communities, full of artists and animators so dedicated to their craft as Techno was, producing all sorts of prodigious and marvellous artwork and a myriad of inspired and talented players built towering monuments to Techno and thousands of celebrities shared their heartfelt tributes and gave their condolences to Technoblade. To Alex. All of whom, sharing that he would never be forgotten and that ‘Technoblade Never Dies!’  </p>

      <h3><b>‘THE FALL OF MEDIA’ </b></h3>
      <h5>If I said that the mainstream is slowly becoming the anti-mainstream, what would that mean to you? For those that are still reading, go to the supplement to read about Minions: Rise of Gru, <span><b>Rudraksh Gangooly 9B</b></span></h5>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>
	  If I said that the mainstream is slowly becoming the anti-mainstream, what would that mean to you? For those that are still reading, go to the supplement to read about Minions: Rise of Gru.  Over the past few years, the oversaturation of media and entertainment has blindsided the implementation of art into popular culture. If I were to tell you that Minions: Rise of Gru deftly marries the bleak, unrelenting tone of its source material with a daring theatrical direction, contrasting with the sprawling epics of thespian hysteria drenched in neon haze of the recent days, with a film of current masterpiece status with little to prove, but enough to satisfy its diehard fans, and welcoming new ones into its cult-like following, would you believe me? Would you take this writer’s words as gospel or satire?  

<p>The truth is, the words of this article will likely be glossed over in the grand scheme of attempts at catering to the generalised animalistic impulses of familiarity through assertions of popular culture.  Whereas the concept of entertainment was once the tinder to a novel landscape of talent, raw human greed has once again found a path to exploit the serotonin, the dopamine and the endorphins for nothing but what a nihilist would see as numbers, numbers in the amount of ineffectual material items, numbers on an ATM machine. Without deterioration into increasingly economical phrasings of our own bleak, self-perpetuating nature of grasping at any chance for our own ambition, whether it be assets or power, and whether it ultimately is at the cost of the sacrifice of others, the world of 'entertainment' or the process of making use of the potential of our conscious' decomposition in response to specifically chemically-engineered content dry will never fade, and will sooner or later never decease, as without our leading figures that one would never see as deceiving or misguiding due to conditioning of loyalty and reliance to the over-arching system from birth, one may have to finally ask themselves whether we live in an artificial world, one where entities of scale far beyond human conception in these numbers that are slowly doubted more and more take every opportunity to capitalise on the vulnerabilities of our own psyche, the psyche capable of tuning out the noise of our ponderous self-inflicted end, and the noise that distracts us from it, which is the noise we will never tune out. 

<p>These traps set out for the public come in many forms. The rise of TikTok has begun to eat away at the attention spans of its young userbase, due to its infinite and addictive nature. As Netflix and other streaming services rapidly grow in expansion across the planet, the pace at which we consume entertainment grows, leaving a growing void of content that must be fully financed and produced at breakneck speeds to satisfy the billions that engage in this culture where the quality of product slowly decreases over time. This brooding consumerism that surrounds media is ever-present and inescapable, your favourite artist will have lines upon lines of merchandise to near-extortionate prices, as the corporate pawns use the average consumer’s lust for what they see as support as the sponsors to their conglomerates. As the standards to satisfying the hyper-active and sensitive minds of children slowly drop over the years from dedicated TV channels (Further reading: Gravity Falls - Shayan Sabeshan) to YouTube videos of industrialised, inane sequences of low-budget animation constructed by an algorithm assessing whatever intellectual properties a child will recognise, often delving into a surreal and inhuman environment, we can only assume the same will happen for the general public as well. Thankfully, a shining beacon in the murky depths of stationary leisure has appeared, in the form of Minions: Rise of Gru, a movie that those of all ages can enjoy. A multi-faceted epic of grand ambition and stunning scope, Minions: Rise of Gru delivers on practically every possible criticism a film like this could face and excels beyond the current standards and boundaries for art in general. And just like how you wouldn’t expect a quick advertisement in the middle of an article criticising the very thing being advertised, the possibilities for monetising every aspect of our lives becomes unpredictable and expands with greater knowledge of human susceptibilities able to be capitalised on.  

<p>With every waking moment, descending into an abyss of a dystopian life becomes more imminent, as more and more of our lives are spent on purely consuming entertainment and a deficit of creative and innovative energy grows. Looking at the 50 highest-grossing films of all time, the current trend of marketability concerns family-friendly blockbusters (with the sole exception of Joker, albeit being from a comic book trademark) produced by a few megalithic corporations again pandering to the people, even if in a less blunt and forwardly extreme method than social media. Social media has been engineered to become the dream of the indolent. With no method of age verification being implemented into these hyper-addictive programs, each generation experiences the lure of constant exposure to the virtual world thriving alongside ours earlier, being rooted deeper into the lives of these very children. 

<p>Gaining insecurity through means of viewing what is presented as the intrinsic basics to one's life via an interface designed to connect, but now is purely used to serve those tenets of cognitive exploitation, is a dangerous game, a game only seen as intrinsic when viewed through the myopic lens of this central indolent that falls in every trap set out for them. But the worst factor being that this indolent is very much aware that he is actively participating in this game but does absolutely nothing to bring himself to face the consequences of what he thinks are rudimentary and eventually meaningless actions, because after all, he is just one of 4.62 billion people connected to the manufactured hivemind for 2 hours and 27 minutes a day. The neurochemical drama of day-to-day life should not be used for capital gain, but nevertheless this system will outlive every person after they die, just multiplying into new forms to adapt to the new levels of extortion that humanity can pull off successfully without any thought of the impact it will have on the future generations. And just like all things have a narrative exactly like a song, a TV show or a movie, they will all have a beginning and an end, but for social media, the end will only occur when the sprawling complexity of the human intellect has entirely diminished, giving this concept a parasitic and destructive lifespan. And now, we are seeing the end of entertainment as we know it now. 

<p>However, the antidote to oversaturation is popularising the antithesis of the ever-popular archetype. In this way, the mainstream is ever-changing and always shifting as radicalism becomes borderline-revolutionary. And as we finally begin to wind down from almost 200-word sentences approaching the style of a purposefully over-sophisticated philosophical manifesto, there may still be uncertainty to whether this was actually a parody of an arrogant and fundamentally egotistically written broadsheet article (hint) or whether anything I mentioned was really taking place. After all, this is all conceptual. But with one last point, viewing the Netflix Top 10 (a system showing the 10 most viewed shows or movies of the day) shows that the consumers tend to favour reality TV more, a more intellectually numb form of entertainment relying on that same method of catering to human impulses with low-stakes drama just like social media. And the same is happening across the board in the world of entertainment. The Spotify Top 50 Songs chart displays dozens upon dozens of commercialised pop songs produced for radio play, written by a dozen record company executives around a table on the top floor of a New York skyscraper trying to wrap their heads around a bar chart of modern trends on a PowerPoint, each having signed a dozen artists completely stripped of artistic value or potential. But the first song, the highest-charting, the most popular song, is different. This is 'Running Up That Hill' by Kate Bush.  

<p>The song has been made popular by the recent season of Stranger Things, released just a few weeks prior to the newspaper's release, but the song itself is from 1985. And it is crushing for this new industry, because amongst all of these attempts to engineer songs that will get the most streams or downloads, the song that beats them all is one from 37 years ago. And it's also quite fitting, as it's the only song on that list to be from the era which is the inverse of everything I have talked about for the past 3 pages, almost as if the only way to gain true, unbridled popularity in the modern age is to look to the past. And this was when the rot of consumerism had not yet settled in to this industry just yet, almost as if it was a wake-up alarm to those dozen executives sitting around that table that their audience was capable of appreciating something other than what has been specifically manufactured for them to enjoy and invest in, because all their audience ever wanted was something that was just unapologetically music for the sake of music, something honest in a dishonest world, something that had the capability to make a resurgence decades after its creation, because finally, after everything that tore media apart, the mainstream went against itself once again, the most popular thing being the opposite of everything popular that came directly before it. And that is quite a beautiful thought, really.
