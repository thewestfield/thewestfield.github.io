      <h3><b>THE FUTURE OF SRI LANKA: HOPEFUL OR HELLISH?</b></h3>
      <h5>Following a brutal and bitter civil war spanning across 25 years, the Republic of Sri Lanka, formerly known as Ceylon, was left crippled and starved with the many tragic effects of the Tamil insurgency., <span> <b> Shayan Sabeshan 9B</b></span></h5>
	  	<p> Including the Sri Lankan Tamil Diaspora, which forced a severance of hundreds upon thousands of innocents from their homes and many expelled and emigrated in fear of racial persecution, the atrocious and gratuitous massacres of the so-called ‘inferior’ Tamils and the thousands left dead in the purposeless pursuit of peace through senseless violence. A country ruined by war, deceit, and strained ethnic tensions, but foremostly a family dynasty in absolute sovereignty of the country. </p>

      <h3><b>How Netflix’s ‘Arcane’ Puts Itself into a League of Its Own </b></h3>
      <h5>Arcane has proven to be one of the greatest shows of all time and the best piece of media of 2021, transcending its video-game roots, <span> <b> Aahnaf Mir 9B</b></span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>With the end of lockdown, 2021 offered a healthy diet of shows: Disney+ shows like WandaVision and Loki, and Netflix shows like Squid Game and Inside Job. All good, but the output was inconsistent in quality. Many shows were publicised but did not quite hit the mark. After a constant stream of mediocrity with a few gems here and there, we finally hit the clear magnum opus of the year in November. Arcane.                                                       Before we delve into what makes the show so good, there are spoilers for Arcane in the last half of this article. You will be warned of the spoiler section when we come to it. For now, enjoy the article.                                                  Arcane is a masterpiece. With 100% on Rotten Tomatoes and 9/10 on IMDb, putting it as the 24th best TV show of all time, Arcane is shown to have a wide range of positive reception. With the presentation, characters, writing, animation, and music, it is evident that Arcane is genuinely the one of the greatest pieces of media to come out of 2021.  </p>
